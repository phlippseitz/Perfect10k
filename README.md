# Perfect10k
Just a small prototype for a route planner that I developed to assist me with taking 10k steps each day.

Some ideas for future work include:
- Solve with actor-critic based on tile-based value function (may incorporate elevation data)
- Try different heuristics for very dense areas i.e. n-fold cycle until average_nodes computationally managable
